/*
AI module requirements:
1. AI refresh once per second: The lastAITick and aiRefreshRate variables ensure the AI updates only once per second.
2. Alternative algorithms: The predictive logic in predictBallY avoids direct chasing and adds strategy without relying on A*.
3. Rule-based AI with heuristics: The prediction and constraints ensure the AI follows logical rules and avoids excessive movement.
4. Adaptation to gameplay: The AI reacts dynamically to ball position and player scores, adapting to gameplay changes.
5. Randomness for realism: The randomness and hesitation mimic human behavior, making the AI feel fair and realistic.
6. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment: The AI speed scales with player performance, making the game balanced and engaging.


Implementation requirement 2: 
The predictive approach and simple rules rely on basic mathematics and game state observation rather than advanced graph-based algorithms like A*. 
These techniques are computationally lighter, easy to implement, and suitable for creating an effective AI player without the complexity of pathfinding algorithms. 
This satisfies the requirement to explore alternative methods while keeping the AI competitive and engaging.

- Prediction of Ball Trajectory:
Instead of relying on advanced pathfinding algorithms like A*, the AI predicts the ball's future Y-coordinate based on 
its current velocity and position using simple mathematical modeling. This prediction includes handling wall bounces, 
making the AI anticipate the ball's position effectively.
This approach is an alternative to A* and focuses on using physics-based heuristics to create a natural AI behavior.
- Rule-Based Decision-Making:
The AI uses simple rules such as only moving toward reachable targets and adjusting its position within the bounds of the game canvas. This avoids the computational overhead of pathfinding and emphasizes straightforward, effective decision-making.
-Randomness and Error Injection (Lines 24-26):
By introducing randomness and hesitations, the AI behaves in a way that resembles human-like play, rather than following an optimal path every time.
